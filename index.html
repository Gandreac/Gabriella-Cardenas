        <h3>Parking time - Your digital parking disc</h3>
        <p> In a world that is becoming increasingly digitized and technologically advanced, much of the analog is being replaced by digital solutions.
            These solutions not only provide a service but also generate valuable data that can support various areas such as urban planning.
            <br><br>
            This underscores the importance of applying UX principles in new and unexpected contexts.
            Matilda Öhman seized upon this trend and created Parking Time, a mobile application that digitizes the analog parking disc.
            <br><br>
            Together with my team, we developed a solution that was based on the users.
            Parking Time's goal was to increase the usage of their digital parking disc over the analog variant and increase the daily number of users from 20 to 500.
            Our endeavor was to design a user-centered solution within the app to meet the users' needs and thereby increase the usage of the digital parking disc.

<h4>Our main question was:</h4> <i><h2>"How can ParkingTime get drivers to choose their digital parking disc over the analog one?"</h2></i>
</div>
</div>

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p> As the disposition manager, my primary responsibility was to keep the project on track.
            This involved organizing and leading meetings with project managers to ensure we stayed within timelines and goals.
            <br><br>
            By providing clear guidelines, such as developing methods for iterative work and using a structured reporting system like Miro and Trello,
            I contributed to ensuring an efficient and well-informed process that resulted in a concise solution, report, and presentation.

        <h3>Basic analysis and preparation</h3>
        <p> The project began with a review of a case brief from ParkingTime and an interview with Matilda Öhman, allowing us to delve into the purpose of the app.
            After carefully examining the existing app to identify its strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for development, we conducted a competitive analysis to gain a broader understanding of the market.
            <br><br>
            To create context and a foundation, we reviewed sources related to the subject and conducted a survey focusing on the importance of parking discs and potential obstacles to their use.
            To quickly test the application's functionality, we asked people in our surroundings to interact with it while we observed their experiences       
            <br><br>
            We also created two behavioral types to categorize and understand different types of user behavior and needs. Through a combination of these methods, we were able to lay the groundwork for the further development of the application.

        <h3>Defining the problems to create innovative solutions</h3>
        <p> Based on our research on parking discs and their usage, we identified two problems hindering Parking Time from increasing its usage.
            <br><br>
           <li>Inadequate marketing (users unaware of Parking Time as an option): This resulted in potential users who could benefit from the service being unaware of its existence.</li>
            <br><br>
        <li>Insufficient app features (users who do not understand the app's functionality): This meant that even if users managed to find Parking Time, they did not continue to use the app
            because its features were not adequately integrated with the analog parking disc.</li>

        <h3>Measures for users unaware of Parking Time as an option</h3>
        <p>Our outcome involved working on their business development due to inadequate marketing, resulting in identifying four main ways to address it. We proposed enhancing signage at parking areas to improve visibility and user awareness, as users tend to favor what feels familiar to them.
            <br><br>
            We also suggested increasing the promotion of Parking Time through municipal channels and collaborating with municipally-owned companies, such as home care services, to boost visibility and usage among Nässjö residents. It's also beneficial for municipalities opting into the service since they've invested in it.
            <br><br>
            We recommended innovative marketing to highlight Parking Time's unique benefits, utilizing strategies like creative flyers with QR codes and advertisements. 
            <br><br>
            Finally, we proposed partnering with local businesses near connected parking areas to enhance visibility and reach more users, anticipating network expansion and increased brand reliability.

        <h3>Measures for users who do not understand the app's functionality</h3>
        <p>To address users who don't grasp the functions, we made interface changes during the prototype phase. We removed unnecessary features identified in the understanding phase, such as "log out" and "change password," as they served no purpose since the app didn't offer any login or password. 
            <br><br>
            We determined that notifications are one of the key conversion factors since the analog parking disc cannot provide the same value. To make the landing page more interactive and informative, we made changes explaining how notifications and location information will enhance the user experience.
            We noticed many users were frustrated with finding parking, especially in crowded areas where the risk of circling and visiting each parking lot was high. In our solution, we added a real-time feature where the number of available parking spaces updates live. 
            <br><br>
            On the homepage, we integrated quick access for experienced users by adding history and favorites, while setting the nearest parking lots as default for less experienced users. 
            <br><br>
            We also made changes to the sidebar menu, including the ability for users to add and change vehicles in the sidebar menu instead of only having access to it in the parking view. Influenced by accessibility and WCAG guidelines, we integrated a tool to customize the app's settings and increase accessibility.
            This included the ability to read aloud, adjust text size, and choose between dark and light modes. Accessibility will play an increasingly significant role in the future, and by implementing this, it will help Parkingtime build greater trust among its users.

        <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
        <p>Group work is crucial for gathering and leveraging diverse perspectives and insights. Focusing on user needs throughout the process, especially during prototyping, is critical to avoid the interface becoming too internally oriented.
            Additionally, I have found that digital parking discs provide an invaluable source of relevant and useful data. By utilizing analysis and statistics, a service, in this case for municipalities joining Parking Time, can offer added value and support their needs and goals.
            These insights will be a central part of my future work and pursuit of creating user-friendly and effective solutions.
